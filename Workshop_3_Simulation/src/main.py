This script implements the complete workflow of an ordinal prediction system for the Severely Impairment Index (SII),
following the architecture diagram. The goal is to transform raw data into predictions
ready to be evaluated in the Kaggle competition "Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use".

Group the PCIAT-PCIAT_Total variable into 4 ordinal categories (0, 1, 2, 3) using quartiles.
This converts the problem into an ordinal classification, as required by the competition.

Train the Random Forest model and validate using QWK, which is the competition metric.
The use of stratified train_test_split ensures all classes are represented in both sets.

Ensure the 'id' column is present in test for the submission so that Kaggle accepts the prediction file.
