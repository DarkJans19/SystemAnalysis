# Child Mind Institute — Problematic Internet Use among Youth – Kaggle Competition Analysis

This project was carried out as part of Workshop 1 for the Systems Analysis course. The objective was to analyze data from the Kaggle competition: **Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use**, and generate a descriptive report identifying relevant patterns and insights regarding problematic internet use among young individuals.

## How the Analysis Was Carried Out
  But out of jest, we analyzed the information step by step, we analyzed the problem, we defined a basic point to work on which was the IBS, from there we looked at the data we had available and how they were related to what we had proposed at the beginning, how they were related to each other and how they influenced each other, from there we made an analysis of that data and defined a model with which we could work the problem, and we looked at how was the feedback of the system from the evaluation

To begin with we started taking into account the problem we had and how we wanted the operation of the program to work in that we thought of the pipeline model to better understand how the data flow was.

## Raising the model
Making use of the model we found some errors within the process of results in the SII in that case we saw all the surveys and HBN instruments that use the program and giving us to know their relationships and interference tantor between them and in the system.

Having the grouping of the data, definition of the problem we looked for a suitable model to the solution of this problem which is in beta phase to recognize if it works correctly in front of the problem in order to make feedback since it was one of the several problems that we had when making this model.
